# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value is the value of the fit of the linear regression. This value makes the line of best fit try to match the plotted values in a graph.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
The predicted blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old is approximately 137.46.
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
The model isn't fully accurate because the graph is based on loosely collected data. The model would be more accurate if more data was collected.
