# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
The model is able to decide which values are more accurate in the sense of the correlation of the graph.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R squared coefficient describes the correlation of the model, as well as the accuracy.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
The model is actually a little more accurate given the method used to create the model. The program actually learns from previously collected data to predict which data makes more sense with a given context, though some of the values are a bit high for a normal blood pressure.
