# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
The R squared coefficient for my model is 0.86. That would mean the model has a strong correlation.
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
My model isn't accurate because again, most of the data is lossely collected.
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
I can't put te he predict feature in the program.
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
This is happening because the coefficients of the x values are negative.
